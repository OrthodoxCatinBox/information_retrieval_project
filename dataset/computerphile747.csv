Sorting Secret - Computerphile,2016-11-18,222387,6979,448,"Two different sorting algorithms are actually the same. Professor Graham Hutton explains. Note from Professor Hutton: It's great to see all the discussions here! To clarify a point raised in some of the comments, the video shows that if you consider the essential underlying idea of selection sort and insertion sort, in terms of how they decompose the problem of sorting, then they perform the same operations but in different orders. Using the picture in the video, selection sort proceeds column at a time and insertion sort proceeds row at a time, but they both perform the same 'triangle' of operations in the end. A particular implementation of these sorting methods may optimise the process in some way, e.g. in a sequential implementation each row can stop comparing numbers once the point of insertion is found. But this is an implementation detail that is dependent on the computational model used, such as sequential versus parallel, or imperative versus functional, rather than part of the essential means by which the sorting methods work.

Computing & Radar Displays - Computerphile,2016-10-12,53510,1397,74,"Not enough just to crunch numbers in Air Traffic Control, you have to be able to display those numbers. John Linfield takes us through the kit.Corrective Comment: The Sony 2K monitors, as used at Swanwick/Prestwick, are not vector graphics displays. The PDP11/34s were more than a 'graphics card' they were Radar Display Processors which handled selection of the required radar data streams from the 12 odd available and also handled the inputs from the various control panels on the controller suite. The 11/34s originally drove as Sector Equipment Group which converted the digital data to vector data to drive the original displays, once the Ericsson displays where introduced they had the SEG functionality built in and were therefore driven directly by the 11/34.

 Dr. Mike's Code: % This script is the one mentioned during the Computerphile Image% Segmentation video. I chose matlab because it's a popular tool for% quickly prototyping things. Matlab licenses are pricey, if you don't have% one (or, like me, work for an organisation that does) try Octave as a% good free alternative. This code should work in Octave too.% Load in an input imageim = imread('C:\Path\Of\Input\Image.jpg');% In matlab, K-means operates on a 2D array, where each sample is one row,% and the features are the columns. We can use the reshape function to turn% the image into this format, where each pixel is one row, and R,G and B% are the columns. We are turning a W,H,3 image into W*H,3% We also cast to a double array, because K-means requires it in matlabimflat = double(reshape(im, size(im,1) * size(im,2), 3));% I specify that initialisation shuold sample points at% random, rather than anything complex like kmeans++ initialisation.% Kmeans++ takes a long time if you are using 256 classes.% Perform k-means. This function returns the class IDs assigned to each% pixel, and in this case we also want the mean values for each class -% what colour is each class. This can take a long time if the value for K% is large, I've used the sampling start strategy to speed things up.% While KMeans is running, it will show you the iteration count, and the% number of pixels that have changed class since last iteration. This% number should get lower and lower, as the means settle on appropriate% values. For large K, it's unlikely that we will ever reach zero movement% (convergence) within 150 iterations.K = 3[kIDs, kC] = kmeans(imflat, K, 'Display', 'iter', 'MaxIter', 150, 'Start', 'sample');% Matlab can output paletted images, that is, grayscale images where the% colours are stored in a separate array. This array is kC, and kIDs are% the grayscale indices.colormap = kC / 256; % Scale 0-1, since this is what matlab wants% Reshape kIDs back into the original image shapeimout = reshape(uint8(kIDs), size(im,1), size(im,2));% Save file out, you need to subtract 1 from the image classes, since once% stored in the file the values should go from 0-255, not 1-256 like matlab% would do.imwrite(imout - 1, colormap, 'C:\Path\Of\Output\Image.png');

A version of this film made with Avid (proprietary software): 
http://youtu.be/nXYly_wnAT4
 This film was produced (almost) entirely with free software. The exception is that I transcoded the original footage to an easier to handle format before I started. The project has taken a week & involved me trying no less than five distros, several types of video editing software and spending hours waiting for renders which most of the time failed. I found a way of working which still took five hours to export from the editing software, in pieces, it was then pieced together by mkvmerge and uploaded.There are some production issues with this film, such as glitchy audio and some harsh cuts, but they are partly down to my inexperience with the specific editing software and lack of patience and not necessarily purely to the software itself. Thanks for reading this footnote - next step is to pull together a film on how I made this one! Sean

Undecidability Tangent (History of Undecidability Part 1) - Computerphile,2014-09-19,153964,3510,223,"What was the first undecidable problem? Professor Brailsford takes us on a computerphile tangent & gives us his angle on a pre-computer example of undecidability.Note from Professor Brailsford: a couple of corrections for this film:1/ ""... early 18th Century"" for Gauss should be "" ... early 19th century"" 2/ ""... 100 years ago"" for Newton should be ""... 100 years before Gauss3/ The Greek word I was struggling with was ""Boeotians"". I have now taken expert advice which tells me that the ""oe"" is pronounced ""ee"" as in ""Oedipus"". Hence a reasonable approximation to the correct pronunciation is ""Bee-oh-shuns""4/ In my excitement to get the message across I sometimes refer, in the video, to Euclid's 5th axiom being a ""proposition"". However it is more accurately a ""postulate"" i.e. something which should be provable from the other axioms/postulates of the Euclidean system. The fact that it can't be thus proved means that the other axioms are insufficiently powerful to prove it -- hence it is ""undecidable"" within that axiom system.""Riemann Hypothesis – Numberphile:

Simon did us a favour by speaking off-the-cuff on this topic and it is our fault for not cleaning up things in the edit. However Simon's (excellent) book covers this in more detail (pages 157-159 in hard cover) and, in it, he opts for nondeterministic without the hyphen.
